The **File Upload** component is designed to facilitate the uploading of files within various modules of the application. While not currently implemented in the Numo scope, this component will be necessary for other modules as the need arises. Its purpose is to provide a user-friendly and accessible way to handle file uploads.

## Usage

- **Purpose**: To allow users to upload files, such as documents, images, or other formats, as required by the application.
- **Typical Use Cases**:
  - Uploading documents or files as part of a form submission.
  - Allowing users to attach files to their profiles or records.
  - Enabling administrators to upload data files or configurations.

## Key Features

- **Multiple File Upload**: Supports the ability to upload multiple files at once, enhancing usability for bulk actions.
- **Drag and Drop**: Users can drag and drop files directly into the designated area for a more intuitive experience.
- **Progress Indicator**: Displays a progress bar or status indicator to show the upload status in real time.
- **File Type Validation**: Allows configuration to accept specific file types (e.g., PDFs, images) to ensure that only the correct formats are uploaded.
- **File Size Limit**: Configurable maximum file size to prevent excessively large uploads that could affect performance.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for any errors during the upload process, such as file size limits or unsupported file types.
- **Accessibility**: Ensures that the upload component is accessible for all users, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Integration**: The component will be integrated into various modules as needed, based on user requirements and workflows.
- **Customization**: Configurable to fit the specific needs of different modules, including style, allowed file types, and size limits.
- **Security**: Includes validation checks and secure handling of uploaded files to protect against malicious content.

## Future Outlook

- **Current Status**: <span style="color:red">Not yet implemented in the existing Numo scope.</span>
- **Planned Implementation**: Will be developed and integrated into other modules as needed, based on future requirements and module-specific needs.

## Additional Notes

- The file upload component will be evaluated and implemented when the need arises in various application modules. At that point, more specific use cases and requirements will be defined.
