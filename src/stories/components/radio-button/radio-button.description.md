- **States**: (hover, disabled, error) for form control.
- **Text (label)** after the radio button icon.
- **Click**: Should be possible on both the checkbox and the text (if the text is related to the specific option).
- If there is no default value and the radio button is required, a red asterisk appears next to the label.
- If there is an error (e.g., not filled out upon saving), the label turns red (instead of the radio button options).
