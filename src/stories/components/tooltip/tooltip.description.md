The Tooltip component from PrimeNG provides a way to display additional information when users hover over or focus on an element. This component is versatile and can be customized for various use cases and styling needs.

## Usage
- **Positioning** (top, left, right): Default is **top**, but if for some reason it doesn't fit, use **left** or **right**.
- **Max symbol capacity**: If longer text is needed, use a **Popover** instead.
- **Formatting**: This applies to the Popover component.
- **Components that should use tooltips by default**: Use tooltips for icons and buttons where a more detailed comment is needed. Tooltips should be used where the symbol might be open to interpretation (e.g., an icon that could have multiple functionalities).
- Do not use tooltips for icons like pencils or trash bins.
- **Delay**: There should be a slight delay before showing the tooltip when hovering with the mouse to prevent flickering.
